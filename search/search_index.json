We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Bloom \u00b6 Model Details \u00b6 BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn\u2019t been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks. ^55afd6 Basics \u00b6 This section provides information about the model type, version, license, funders, release date, developers, and contact information. \u2003 It is useful for anyone who wants to reference the model. Technical Specifications \u00b6 This section includes details about the model objective and architecture, and the compute infrastructure. \u2003 It is useful for people interested in model development.","title":"Embed AI"},{"location":"notes/Embed%20AI/#embed-ai","text":"excerpt lorem ipsum","title":"Embed AI"},{"location":"notes/Embed%20AI/#cool-paragraph","text":"","title":"cool paragraph"},{"location":"notes/Embed%20AI/#whisper","text":"","title":"whisper"},{"location":"notes/Embed%20AI/#what-is-whisper","text":"Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.
